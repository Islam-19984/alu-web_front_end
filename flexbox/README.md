  Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model designed to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structures without using float or positioning. It allows for the efficient arrangement of elements, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

Key features of Flexbox include:

1. **Direction-agnostic**: Flexbox is well-suited for layouts that must accommodate different screen sizes and display devices. Unlike block (vertically-based) or inline (horizontally-based) layouts, Flexbox works in both directions.

2. **Container and items**: The Flexbox model involves a parent container and child elements. The parent container becomes a flex container with `display: flex;` or `display: inline-flex;`, and its direct children become flex items.

3. **Main axis and cross axis**: Flexbox involves two axes. The main axis is defined by the `flex-direction` property (row or column), and the cross axis is perpendicular to it. This helps in aligning items horizontally or vertically and distributing space between items.

4. **Alignment**: You can align items along the main or cross axis using properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `align-self`.

5. **Flexibility**: The `flex` property allows flex items to grow or shrink to fit the space available in the container. This property is a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.

6. **Ordering**: Flexbox gives you the ability to order flex items without changing the HTML structure, using the `order` property.

Flexbox simplifies the process of creating complex layouts and alignments, particularly useful for responsive and modern web design.
